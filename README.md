# Suano

**Suano** is a sleek, lightweight utility for macOS and Linux that brings powerful AI writing assistance to any application. Just select text, press a global hotkey, and let AI fix your grammar, rephrase, or answer follow-up questions.

## Available Platforms

This repository contains native native implementations for both macOS and Linux:

- **🍎 [macOS (Swift)](macos/README.md)**: A native macOS menu bar utility built with AppKit and SwiftUI.
- **🐧 [Linux (Rust + GTK4)](linux-rust/README.md)**: A Wayland port for Linux, built with Rust and GTK4.

## Features

- **Global Hotkey:** Trigger the AI assistant instantly from any app (e.g., `⌘⇧G` on macOS, `<Ctrl><Shift>G` on Linux).
- **AI Writing Assistance:** Fix spelling, grammar, and improve clarity.
- **Follow-up Chat:** Ask the AI questions about your selected text context.
- **Paste Back:** Instantly paste the AI's response back into your source application.
- **Customizable:** Works with **OpenAI** (GPT-4o, etc) and **Ollama** (Llama 3, Gemma, etc).

## Installation & Configuration

Because there are distinct native implementations for macOS and Linux, please see the specific instructions in each specialized subdirectory:

- **macOS:** See the [macOS Instructions](macos/README.md).
- **Linux:** See the [Linux Instructions](linux-rust/README.md).

## Security & Privacy 🔒

Suano is built with security in mind:
- **API Key Storage:** On macOS, API keys are securely stored in the system's underlying native Keychain framework. On Linux, API keys are encrypted at rest using the Secret Service API (`libsecret`), interfacing with GNOME Keyring or KDE KWallet, and configuration files are heavily restricted via Unix permissions (`0600`).
- **No Telemetry:** We collect zero telemetry, analytics, or diagnostics. Your keystrokes and data are processed entirely between your machine and your chosen AI endpoint.
- **Secure Daemons:** The Linux daemon used for simulating keyboard automation is strictly restricted by user ownership and permissions to prevent local privilege escalation or unauthenticated key injection.
