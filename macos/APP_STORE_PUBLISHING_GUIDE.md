# AIHelper Mac App Store Publishing Guide

This document explains how to publish AIHelper to the Apple Mac App Store.

## 1. Current Readiness Review (Important)

Before submitting, verify these items. Status reflects the current codebase:

1. App Sandbox and entitlement configuration.
- Status: fixed.
- `AIHelper.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` now sets `ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = YES`.
- `AIHelper/AIHelper.entitlements` now has `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` set to `true`.

2. App identity strings consistency.
- Status: fixed.
- `AIHelper.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` now sets `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName = AIHelper`.
- User-facing `Paragraph` strings were replaced with `AIHelper`.

3. Privacy-related permission copy.
- Status: fixed.
- `AIHelper/Info.plist` permission descriptions now reference AIHelper and explain shortcut/copy-paste behavior.

4. API key storage security.
- Status: fixed.
- API key storage has been moved from `UserDefaults` to Keychain Services.

5. Deployment target sanity.
- Status: fixed.
- `AIHelper.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` now uses `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 13.0`.

> [!TIP]
> **Build Warning:** You might see a warning about `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`. If your app supports Ollama (local AI), you should add this key to `Info.plist` with a description like: "AIHelper connects to local AI services like Ollama."

## 2. Apple Account and App Store Connect Setup

1. Enroll in Apple Developer Program (organization or individual).
2. In App Store Connect, create a new macOS app record:
- Platform: macOS
- Name: AIHelper
- Primary language
- Bundle ID: must match Xcode `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`
- SKU: internal unique value
3. Complete Agreements, Tax, and Banking in App Store Connect.

## 2.5 Pricing and Availability ($5.00)

To set your price to $5.00:

1. In App Store Connect, go to **Pricing and Availability**.
2. Click **Add Pricing**.
3. Select the **$4.99** price tier (Apple uses tiers, so $4.99 is the standard "five dollar" price point).
4. Select all territories (or specific ones) and click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Apple takes a 15% to 30% commission depending on your enrollment in the Small Business Program.

## 3. Xcode Project Configuration Checklist

In target `AIHelper` (Release config):

1. Signing and capabilities
- Enable App Sandbox.
- Keep only entitlements that are required.
- Ensure Team and Bundle Identifier match App Store Connect.

2. Versioning
- Set `MARKETING_VERSION` (for example `1.0.0`).
- Increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` for each upload.

3. Info metadata
- `CFBundleDisplayName`: set to `AIHelper` (or your final brand, consistently).
- Confirm `LSApplicationCategoryType` is correct (`public.app-category.productivity` is fine).
- Replace permission description text with accurate wording using your app name.

4. Privacy and network
- If connecting only to remote APIs, do not include unused local network descriptions.
- Provide a clear privacy policy URL in App Store Connect.

## 4. Required Code/Config Changes Before Submission

1. Sandbox
- Set `ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = YES`.
- Set `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` entitlement to `true`.
- Keep `com.apple.security.network.client = true` for outbound API calls.

2. Permission text cleanup
- Replace `Paragraph` references with `AIHelper` in:
  - `AIHelper/Info.plist`
  - `AIHelper/AppDelegate.swift` accessibilityDescription

3. Secure API key storage
- Move API key persistence from `UserDefaults` to Keychain Services.
- Keep only non-sensitive settings (provider/base URL/model) in `UserDefaults`.

4. Deployment target
- Lower `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to the oldest supported macOS version you test.

5. Provider defaults and transparency
- Confirm default provider endpoint/model are intentional and documented.
- If default is not OpenAI, update UI labels/help text so users are not misled.

## 5. Build, Archive, and Upload

1. In Xcode, select the `AIHelper` scheme and `Any Mac (Apple Silicon, Intel)`.
2. Product -> Archive (Release).
3. In Organizer:
- Validate App
- Distribute App -> App Store Connect -> Upload
4. Resolve any validation errors and re-archive if needed.

## 6. App Store Connect Submission Fields

Complete the following for the app version:

1. App description, subtitle, keywords, support URL, marketing URL (optional).
2. Privacy policy URL (required for apps handling user text and network requests).
3. Screenshots for required Mac display sizes:
   - **Primary Size:** 1280 x 800 (standard) or 1440 x 900.
   - **Retina Size:** 2560 x 1600 or 2880 x 1800.
   - *Tip:* Use `Cmd + Shift + 4` then `Space` to take a clean screenshot of just the window.

> [!TIP]
> **What to show in screenshots:**
> 1. **The Hero Shot:** The main popup over some text in a document (e.g., Mail or Notes).
> 2. **The "Fixing" State:** The popup with loading dots or a fresh AI response.
> 3. **The Settings:** Show the Shortcut Settings view to prove customization.
> 4. **Modern UI:** Showcase the dark mode and premium design we built.
4. Age rating questionnaire.
5. Export compliance (encryption questions).
6. App Privacy section:
- Declare that selected user text may be transmitted to AI provider endpoints.
- Declare diagnostics/identifiers only if collected.

## 7. App Review Notes (Recommended)

In "Notes for App Review", explain:

1. Why Accessibility permission is required (global shortcut and selected text workflow).
2. Why Apple Events/clipboard-style automation is required (copy/paste integration).
3. That user-triggered text is sent to configured AI provider endpoints.
4. How users configure provider/API key in Settings.

## 7.5 App Review Strategy: The "Sandbox" Challenge

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because your app is Sandboxed (required for App Store), Apple is very strict about apps that request **Accessibility Permissions** to read/control other apps. 

To pass review:
1. **Explain the Workflow:** Be very clear that AIHelper only captures text *when the user presses the shortcut*. It does not "spy" passively.
2. **Provide a Demo Video:** Upload a video to App Store Connect showing you using the shortcut to fix text. This helps the reviewer understand the utility.
3. **App Store Guidelines:** Be prepared to argue that your app falls under "Productivity" and the Accessibility permission is the *only* way to provide the "Paste-back" feature seamlessly.

## 8. Release and Post-Release

1. Submit for review.
2. Monitor App Store Connect for metadata or binary rejection notes.
3. After approval, release manually or automatically.
4. Track crashes/feedback and prepare `1.0.1` bugfix build.
